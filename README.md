Northeastern University - Application Engineering and Development - Java - Exercises and Final Project


Exercise 0 :

Declare 10 classes based on objects around you

Include 2 nested classes for one of class

Each class must have at least 8 properties & 3 methods (no logic inside methods is fine, i.e., empty methods or just a print statement)

Print a statement in constructor to indicate creation of each instance, preferably identify each instance with unique id/name

Create a Main method to instantiate at least 3 objects of each class


Exercise 4 :

Write a console program in Java to exercise at least 5 regular expressions patterns and demonstrate positive and negative cases using at least one subject string for each case.


Exercise 8 : 

Create a Java program to parse the following structure in XML and JSON. You need to create your own sample XML and JSON to be used for the program with at least three entries for 'Book' element and it's sub-elements. Print output of the each parser on console. Add an additional entry for 'book' element programmatically and reprint the document through parser to confirm that is has been added correctly.

Note: Authors element can have multiple authors, may use array in JSON
