**Exercise 0 :**

Declare 10 classes based on objects around you

Include 2 nested classes for one of class

Each class must have at least 8 properties & 3 methods (no logic inside methods is fine, i.e., empty methods or just a print statement)

Print a statement in constructor to indicate creation of each instance, preferably identify each instance with unique id/name

Create a Main method to instantiate at least 3 objects of each class

---

**Exercise 1 :**
Create a class hierarchy with base class as Student and derived classes are Part-Time and Full-Time

Full-time students will have an extra field to hold two Exam scores

Use suitable data structure to hold 15 quizzes scores for each student (part-time or full-time)

Create a class Session

Use data structure to hold 20 students in a Session, some are part-time, some are full-time

Create public methods to calculate average quiz scores per student for the whole class

Create public method to print the list of quiz scores in ascending order for one session

Create public method to print names of part-time students

Create public method to print exam scores of full-time students

Main Program

Create an instance of Session, populate it with 20 students and dummy scores

Call all public methods of Session and capture the output of those methods on console

---

Exercise 2 :

Create a class hierarchy for base class Shape and derived classes Triangle, Rectangle, Circle and Square

Demonstrate concepts of abstraction, overriding, polymorphism and static field

May use methods such as 'calculateArea()', 'calculatePerimeter()', etc. as needed for demonstrating concepts

May use static field to represent color of the class or name of the class to represent concept of static fields

---

Exercise 3b :

Make the classes in exercise # 2 serializable

Test serialization and deserialization of the objects created in exercise # 2.

---

Exercise 4 :

Write a console program in Java to exercise at least 5 regular expressions patterns and demonstrate positive and negative cases using at least one subject string for each case.

---

Exercise 6 :

Create two objects - Alice and Bob

Demonstrate symmetric encryption and decryption of message sent between Alice and Bob

Use AES-256 encryption with GCM/NoPadding cipher

Demonstrate asymmetric encryption and decryption of message sent between Alice and Bob

Use RSA-2048 encryption ECB/PKCS1Padding

Demonstrate signing a message and validating the signature using RSA-2048 keys between Alice and Bob

---

Excercise 7 :

(a) Write a generic method to count the number of elements in a collection that have a specific property (for example, odd integers, prime numbers, palindromes).

(b) Write a generic method to exchange the positions of two different elements in an array.

(c) Write a generic method to find the maximal element in the range [begin, end) of a list.

---

Exercise 8 : 

Create a Java program to parse the following structure in XML and JSON. You need to create your own sample XML and JSON to be used for the program with at least three entries for 'Book' element and it's sub-elements. Print output of the each parser on console. Add an additional entry for 'book' element programmatically and reprint the document through parser to confirm that is has been added correctly.

Note: Authors element can have multiple authors, may use array in JSON

Exercise 9 :

Create four function calculator using JavaFX

	Hint: Keep the GUI and layout simple. One such example of simple layout is in JavaFX slide deck in the course material.
