Northeastern University - Application Engineering and Development - Java - Exercises and Final Project


Exercise 0 :

Declare 10 classes based on objects around you

Include 2 nested classes for one of class

Each class must have at least 8 properties & 3 methods (no logic inside methods is fine, i.e., empty methods or just a print statement)

Print a statement in constructor to indicate creation of each instance, preferably identify each instance with unique id/name

Create a Main method to instantiate at least 3 objects of each class


Exercise 6 :

Create two objects - Alice and Bob

Demonstrate symmetric encryption and decryption of message sent between Alice and Bob

Use AES-256 encryption with GCM/NoPadding cipher

Demonstrate asymmetric encryption and decryption of message sent between Alice and Bob

Use RSA-2048 encryption ECB/PKCS1Padding

Demonstrate signing a message and validating the signature using RSA-2048 keys between Alice and Bob
